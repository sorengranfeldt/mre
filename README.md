# Project Description
This FIM2010 R2 Codeless Provisioning Framework, called Forefront Identity Manager 2010 (FIM) Metaverse Rules Extension (hereafter MRE), is a standalone extension that allows administrators to create advanced provisioning and deprovisioning rules for FIM without writing a single line of code.

The use of MRE can, of course, be combined with Declarative Provisioning using Synchronization Rules (SRs) in FIM 2010. Sometimes, you may only need to provision some objects between a few management agents without the need for these objects to go to the FIM Service to have a Synchronization Rule (SR) applied, and that's where the MRE comes in handy.

By creating an XML document using a text or XML editor, FIM administrators can build, change, or remove provisioning and deprovisioning rules in FIM without recompiling. Basically, MRE enables codeless provisioning in FIM and acts as a replacement or supplement for Synchronization Rules (SRs) in FIM.
